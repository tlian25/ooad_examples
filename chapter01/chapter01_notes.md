# Chapter 1 Notes:


Great software delivers on the following three fronts:
1. Delivers on customer needs and wants
2. Extends flexibility
3. Maintainable and reusable design


**Enumerated Types**
- allows us to define a set of values allowed for a type
- don't have to worry about string comparisons
- will catch incorrect usage and unsupported values on compiling

**Encapsulation**
- process of enclosing programming elements inside larger, more abstract entities
- information hiding or separation of concerns
- hide implementation of a class in a way that's easy to use and change
- allows us to hide the inner workings of app's parts but makes clear what each part does
- makes class act as a black box that provides a service to users

**Delegation**
- forwarding an operation to another object to be performed on behalf of the caller object
